"Your challenge is to produce the worst user interface you can think of. Bonus points if the your solution actually works."

I couldn't think anything worse than a form in which every element is a div.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
